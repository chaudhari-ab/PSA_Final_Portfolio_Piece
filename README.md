This Project Explains the Kruskal's Algorithm of Graph Theory. 
And Visualises the Algorithm Using JavaScript and React Library.

The discrete mathematics field of graph theory introduces the idea of Kruskal's algorithm. A connected weighted graph's shortest path between any two locations is found using this method. For a given graph, a minimal spanning tree is created using the Kruskal algorithm. But what exactly is a Minimum Spanning Tree? A subset of a graph called a minimum spanning tree has edges equal to the number of vertices -1 and the same number of vertices as the original graph. For the total of all edge weights in a spanning tree, it likewise has a low cost.
Only if the selected edge does not form a cycle does Kruskal's method keep adding nodes to the tree. It sorts all edges in ascending order of their edge weights. Additionally, it chooses the edge with the lowest cost first and the highest cost last. In order to discover the global optimal solution, the Kruskal algorithm thus makes a locally optimal decision. Because of this, it is known as a greedy algorithm.
